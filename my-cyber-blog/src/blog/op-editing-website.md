Setting up this blog.

1. I work in mechatronics, making sensors, robotics and using any tools to create and amplify physical effects we see in the universe.

2. I am now in the process of finishing this website, and displaying some projects, stay tuned.

3. If you have any questions feel free to reach me at my github
